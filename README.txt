C++ Summer Lecture Series 2016

During the Summer of 2016 the STE||AR Group @ LSU will be hosting
a C++ lecture series. These sessions will cover advanced C++ techniques
which are widely used in HPX libraries and applications such as the
STL, SFINAE, and meta-template programming to name a few.

You can find a copy of the code presented in these talks here in this
repository, which complement the videos posted on our YouTube Channel:
